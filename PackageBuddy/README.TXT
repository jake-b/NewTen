You need to install the PkgBuddy.pkg file onto the Newton using the Newton Backup Utility.

PC Instructions
------
You might want to check the preferences in the edit menu to make sure the com port is set right.
1) Select Get Package from the File Menu.
2) Name the package file you're going to receive. (AppName.pkg usually) Make sure you keep track of where you save the file.
NOTE: There is a timeout on the PC side, so you might want to get the Newton to the point where it displays the connection screen before you accept the file name.

Make sure you start the connection on the PC first. People have complained that starting the Newton first doesn't work.


Newton Instructions
------
1) Hilite one icon in the extras drawer by holding down on it until the newton cheeps.
2) Hit the envelope icon and select 'Export to PC', 
The newton will now prepare the file. This can take some time on a larger packages. It also takes up space on your newton temporarily, make sure there is at least as much free space available as the package takes up.
3) Select PC from choices.
4) Hit the connect button after the PC is waiting
